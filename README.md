Project title: is_palindrome 


Since we're testing if a word is palindrome, we have a word (string) as an input. Both "start" and "end" are serving as counter variables. The variables keep track of the positions of the characters from both ends of the word , and they are incremented and decremented inside the loop to move towards the center of the word. The return-type will be a boolean whereby the output is "true" if the word is a palindrome. Otherwise, it's false. The base case in this case happens if the length of the word is 0 or 1. In such a case, the return-value is true since an empty word or a single character is considered a palindrome. The recursive case happens during the comparison of the first and last characters of the word. If they are equal, a recursive call with the substring execluding the first and last characters is made. If they're not equal, the return-value is false implying the word isn't a palindrome. In brief, the algorithm recursively compares the first and last characters of the word and continues checking the rest of the word until it either finds a mismatch (return false) or the base case is reached (return true).
